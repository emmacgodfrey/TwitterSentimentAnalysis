Recent research proposes that today's political polarization is a result of companies collecting minute, individual level data through one's presence on the internet, also called Big Data. With this data, companies such as Twitter and Facebook suggest new content with a goal to echo the individuals prior beliefs. While the goal is to maximize user engagement and thereby profit, it has knowingly and willingly exacerbated the political divide. For instance, a Twitter user who likes a democrat's tweet discussing gun laws in California will thereafter experience an influx of left-leaning content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google etc. Unbenounced to the user, they are not exposed to the general "news", but rather a "news" that is individually curated to further engrain their pre-existing beliefs. 

CNN and Fox News are the most popular news sources in the United States, however their audiences are politically skewed. CNN (Cable News Network) has a viewership consisting of 51% Democrats, 23% Independent, 18% Republican, and 8% Unknown. Contrastingly, Fox News reports to 39% Republicans, 33% Democrat, 22% Independent, and 6% Unknown. While niether network caters to entirely democratic or republican audiences, CNN and Fox News are the most popular news networks with skewed viewerships. Due to their skewed yet wide-stretched audiences, the networks make for an optimal case-study of political polarization. I identify as a Democrat. I know that my online presence pigeon-holes my exposure to news that agrees with my algorithmically determined beliefs. However, how different is the news that I read from my Republican counterpart? In this paper, I am going to conduct an in-depth sentiment text analysis using CNN and Fox News Twitter data to investigate the differences in sentiment and content between the news sources and the resulting impact on political polarization.
